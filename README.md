# APA_Converter

Converts bibliographical data from a `.txt` file exported from the Web of Science into bibliographical references in APA (American Psychological Association) referencing.

## Instructions for Use

This Python script converts data from the file `biblio.txt` into APA and generates a new file named `newrefs.txt` in the same directory. Make sure to follow the steps below to execute the script correctly.

### Prerequisites

Unzip the file `txt2APA converter.zip`. Ensure you have the following items in the same directory:

- `biblio.txt`: The input file containing the data to be processed.
- `_internal` (folder): Contains necessary files for the internal functioning of the script.
- `biblio.exe`: Script executable.

### Running the Script

#### If using a terminal:

1. Open a terminal or command line.
2. Navigate to the directory where the files are located (`biblio.txt`, `_internal`, `biblio.exe`).
3. Execute the script using the following command: `biblio.exe`.
4. If everything is correct, you will now have your `newrefs.txt` file in the same directory.

#### If using `biblio.exe` directly:

1. Double-click on `biblio.exe`.
2. If everything is correct, you will now have your `newrefs.txt` file in the same directory.
